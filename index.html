      <h2>Introduction to Internet</h2>
      <p>
        The Internet is a worldwide organization of billions of PCs and other electronic gadgets. With the Internet, it's possible
        to get to practically any data, speak with any other person on the planet, and do significantly more.<br />
        You can do all of this by associating a PC to the Internet, which is likewise called going on the web. At point when
        somebody says a PC is on the web, it's simply one more approach to saying it's associated with the Internet.

      <p>
        Be it for a Google search for your favorite movie, or an email to a friend, what's essentially happening when you use the
        internet is that you're sending a message from your device to another device. Thus, when you use the internet, what you're
        doing is sending and receiving messages (requests) to and from other computers and devices on the network.
      </p>
      <h3>Data Transmission on the Internet</h3>
      <img src="../assets/internet.gif" alt="../assets/internet.gif" />
      <p>
        The computers and devices that we use are called clients and the computers that websites such as Google or Facebook use
        are called servers. The websites we access are all files on the hard disks of the respective servers. Our devices do not
        directly access these files. When we access google.com for example, our client device forwards its requests to Google
        servers via our internet service providers (ISPs). The results also come to us via our ISPs. Which is why we cannot access
        the internet if our connection to our ISPs gets terminated.<br />
        Also, these messages and requests aren't sent or received as a whole. Any time you use the internet, your message is
        broken down into units called <b>packets</b> that travel through the network to its destination. Upon arrival at the
        destination, the packets are put together in the original order. You can think of a packet as a chunk of your message
        query. Or like a part of a jigsaw puzzle that needs to be solved at the destination. If for some reason the packets aren't
        put together in the right order at the right time, the results are in the form of distorted content. Like when a video
        lags, or a web page doesn't load properly.But there are millions of people and devices accessing the internet at any given
        time. Which means countless packets of data. So how do these packets of data find their way to their intended destination?
        Every device connected to the internet has its own unique I.P address which acts as the postal address does in the
        physical world. And to make the data flow smoother and avoid data traffic jams, there are routers. Routers sort the
        packets based on their destination and ensure that they end up on the right device and not on other devices on the
        network.
      </p>
      <div id="internetp"><br /><br /></div>
      <h3>Internet protocol</h3>

      <p>
        The IP protocol (an acronym for Internet Protocol) is one of the key protocols of the Internet along with the transport
        protocols TCP and UDP. IP works on several types of networks such as Ethernet for local networks, but can also be
        encapsulated on other protocols such as ATM, even if more and more IP is establishing itself as the universal protocol.
        <br />
        It provides data routing information on the network, and describes a method of fragmenting the information to be
        transported, in the form of datagrams. For example, a message of a length of one million bytes transported over an IP
        network will be cut into a multitude of datagrams (or IP packets) - these packets include multiple header fields, the
        source IP address and the recipient's IP address, followed by the data itself - by its sender, then sent to its recipient
        who will be responsible for reassembling the packets to reconstruct the source message.
      </p>
      <div id="ip"><br /><br /></div>
      <h3>IP Adresses</h3>
      <p>
        The Internet Protocol Address, abbreviated as "IP address" or simply "IP", is based on the Internet Protocol which also
        forms the basis of the Internet network. This is the clearly identifiable address of a device (e.g. computer, web server,
        printer) within an internal or external network. An IP address can also refer to a set of devices, especially in the case
        of broadcast or multicast broadcasting. Similarly, several addresses can be assigned to the same computer. In any case,
        one thing is immutable: each IP address can only be assigned once at the same time within a network.
      </p>
      <h4>How is an IP address structured?</h4>
      <p>
        There are two versions of IP addresses with very different structures. They have in common the fact of being composed of a
        network part (for routing in the case of IP routing) and a host part (for allocation to a particular computer).
      </p>
      <div id="dns"><br /><br /></div>
      <h3>DNS</h3>
      <p>
        The DNS (Domain Name System) server is a service whose main function is to translate a domain name into an IP address. To
        simplify, the DNS server acts as a directory that a computer consults when accessing another computer via a network. In
        other words, the DNS server is this service which makes it possible to associate an IP address with a website (or a
        connected computer or a server), like a telephone directory makes it possible to associate a telephone number with a
        subscriber name.

      <h3>Paquets (TCP and UDP)</h3>

      <ul>
        <li>TCP</li>
        <p>
          TCP stands for Transmission Control Protocol a communications standard that enables application programs and computing
          devices to exchange messages over a network. It is designed to send packets across the internet and ensure the
          successful delivery of data and messages over networks. TCP is one of the basic standards that define the rules of the
          internet and is included within the standards defined by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF). It is one of the
          most commonly used protocols within digital network communications and ensures end-to-end data delivery.
        </p>
        <li>UDP</li>
        <p>
          The User Datagram Protocol, or UDP, is a communication protocol used across the Internet for especially time-sensitive
          transmissions such as video playback or DNS lookups. It speeds up communications by not formally establishing a
          connection before data is transferred. This allows data to be transferred very quickly, but it can also cause packets to
          become lost in transit â€” and create opportunities for exploitation in the form of DDoS attacks.
        </p>
      </ul>

      <div id="http"><br /><br /></div>
      <h3>HTTP</h3>
      <p>
        Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is an application-layer protocol for transmitting hypermedia documents, such as HTML.
        It was designed for communication between web browsers and web servers, but it can also be used for other purposes. HTTP
        follows a classical client-server model, with a client opening a connection to make a request, then waiting until it
        receives a response. HTTP is a stateless protocol, meaning that the server does not keep any data (state) between two
        requests.
      </p>

      <div id="html"><br /><br /></div>
      <h3>HTML</h3>
      <p>
        HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the most basic building block of the Web. It defines the meaning and structure of web
        content. Other technologies besides HTML are generally used to describe a web page's appearance/presentation (CSS) or
        functionality/behavior (JavaScript).
      </p>

      <div id="routers"><br /><br /></div>
      <h3>Routers</h3>
      <p>
        A router is a device that connects two or more packet-switched networks or subnetworks. It serves two primary functions:
        managing traffic between these networks by forwarding data packets to their intended IP addresses, and allowing multiple
        devices to use the same Internet connection. There are several types of routers, but most routers pass data between LANs
        (local area networks) and WANs (wide area networks). A LAN is a group of connected devices restricted to a specific
        geographic area. A LAN usually requires a single router.
